# Intro to the Intro

Data structures are just classes that help us to structure data.

Technically, when we define Classes we're already structuring data by organizing related data together as members of the class. But when we say "Data Structures", we are referring to design patterns that are well-known to the programming world.

Each data structure is designed to be general solutions to different problems like:
- "How do I manage a group of objects where the number of objects can change while the program is running?"
- "How can I efficiently find an object in a group of objects where each object has a unique name?"

Or solutions to more specific problems like:
- "How do I model roads between different cities and find a shortest path between any two cities?"
- "How can I keep a 'history' of moves I try while solving a puzzle game?"

Each data structure has it's own advantages and disadvantages for how it organizes data, which we will cover as we go over specific examples.

Choosing the correct data structure to use can greatly simplify the problem you're trying to solve.
