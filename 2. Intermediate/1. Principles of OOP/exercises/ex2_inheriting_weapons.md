# Inheriting Weapons
Create a base Weapon class. Use this class as a parent to create child classes for more specific weapons (bow, dagger, staff, rat-tied-to-a-stick, whatever). 

Each of your weapons should have the following methods:
1. A constructor to set the weapon damage
2. ```get_dmg()``` returns the damage amount
3. ```noise()``` prints the noise the weapon makes when attacking.

Reduce code duplication by putting shared code in the parent class.

Try creating at least 3 specific weapon classes.
