# Exercise 2.1: Update Your Character

1. Update <code>character_health</code> by using operations instead of by direct reassignment.
- Decrement health (you got hit!)
- Multiply health (healing spell)

2. Update <code>character_name</code> by using + to concatenate a title/class to the end of the name.

> Wowie, you can use + with numbers _and_ strings.
