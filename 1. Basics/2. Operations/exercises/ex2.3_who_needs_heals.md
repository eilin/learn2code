# Exercise 2.3: Who Needs Heals?

Define variables: <code>vex_health</code>, <code>my_health</code>, and <code>low_health</code>. Make either Vex's or your health below the "low" threshold, and the other above it.

1. Define a variable <code>vex_needs_healing</code> and assign it accordingly, comparing his health and the threshold.

2. Define a variable <code>everyone_needs_healing</code> and assign it to True if both you and Vex have low health.
