# Operations

Now that we have variables, let's do something with them.

## Number Operations
We can use mathematical operations on numbers
- a = 1 - 1
- b = 2 + 2
- c = 3 * 3
- d = 4 / 4

And just like algebra, we can use operations on variables

<code>
health = 80

sword_dmg = 7

fire_multiplier = 2

health = health - sword_dmg * fire_multiplier
</code>

Operations are resolved in the same order as real math (PEMDAS). You can also use parenthesis to specify the order (like real math!).

<code>
my_payout = (quest_reward + total_loot_found) / party_size
</code>
