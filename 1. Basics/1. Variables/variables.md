# Variables

Programming comes from computer science, which stems from math. Just like in math, we have "variables" - just something that stores a value.

<code>x = 10</code>

Looks like the answer to an algebra problem, but it's valid python code as well!

This piece of code, or _statement_, declares a variable called "x" and assigns it the value of 10.

Unlike in math, variables can hold more than just numbers.

<code>vp = 'How do you want to do this?'</code>

This time we declare a variable called "vp" and it's value is a sequence of characters (alphabetical, numberic, and punctuation).

## Strings
In programming, we call a sequence of characters like that a **string**. In python, a string is defined as anything between single or double quotes. The following are all strings as well:
- 'single'
- "double"
- 'spaces, numbers, and special characters work'
- '1234567890!@#$%^&*()<>,.?/[]{}'
- ""

## Variable names
Valid variable names in python are limited to characters (upper and lowercase), numbers, and _

These are valid names:
- my_var
- my_var2

We usually try to be descriptive when naming variables. A better name for <code>vp</code> in the example above would be <code>victory_phrase</code> since that's what it is.
> In python, the standard convention for multi-word variable names is to write it in lowercase with _ replacing spaces. While this is valid code <br><code>PiValue = 3.14</code>, it's best to follow a language's standard for consistency.

## Conclusion
We've seen variables, how to name them, how to assign them a value, and 2 types of data already: numbers and strings.
