# Exercise 5.1: Poison Damage

Write a method that uses a while loop to simulate poison damage over multiple turns, printing the current health at the end of each turn.

1. Write the method so 2 damage is dealt every turn until the victim is dead. The method signature should be: <code>poisoned(health)</code>

2. Write the method so 2 damage is dealt every turn for N turns, or until the victim is dead. The method signature should be: <code>poisoned(health, n)</code>
