# Exercise 4.1: Arm Wrestling

Define variables <code>my_strength</code>, <code>scanlan_strength</code>, and <code>grog_strength</code>.

> Make sure your strength is more than Scanlan's and less than Grog's

Define a method called <code>arm_wrestle</code> that takes the names and strengths of 2 people and prints the name of the stronger person.

The method signature will look like:

<code>arm_wrestle(n1, s1, n2, s2)</code>

Use the method you wrote to test arm wrestling between you vs Scanlan and then you vs Grog.
