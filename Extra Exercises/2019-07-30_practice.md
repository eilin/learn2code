# 2019-07-26 Practice

There are 2 parts to this exercise, do them in order.

## Part 1
The party pools together some of their belongings as part of a small wager they're placing. They win the bet and go to get their stuff back.

You are given two lists of Person objects and Gear objects, ```party``` and ```everyones_stuff```. Each Gear object has a "owner" field, which marks who it belongs to. Each Person object has a gear field, which is initially set as None.

Assign each Gear object back to the rightful owner.

Use the following given code:
```

class Gear:
    def __init__(self, name, owner):
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner # string, not Person

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.gear = None

party = [
    Person('Grog'),
    Person('Vex'),
    Person('Percy'),
    Person('Scanlan')
]

everyones_stuff = [
    Gear('Whetstone', 'Grog'),
    Gear('Bow String', 'Vex'),
    Gear('Lead Shot', 'Percy'),
    Gear('Fancy Hat', 'Scanlan')
]


#
# Your code goes here
#


# Testing
correct = 0
for person in party:
    if person.gear.owner == person.name:
        correct += 1
assert correct == len(party)
print("Ok!")
```

## Part 2
Same as part 1 but 2 lines have been added: an ```import``` at the top, and a line that shuffles the list of gear. Depending on how you did part 1, it might not change your solution - but it probably will.

```
from random import shuffle

class Gear:
    def __init__(self, name, owner):
        self.name = name
        self.owner = owner

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        self.gear = None

party = [
    Person('Grog'),
    Person('Vex'),
    Person('Percy'),
    Person('Scanlan')
]

everyones_stuff = [
    Gear('Whetstone', 'Grog'),
    Gear('Bow String', 'Vex'),
    Gear('Lead Shot', 'Percy'),
    Gear('Fancy Hat', 'Scanlan')
]

# the list is in a different order now!
shuffle(everyones_stuff)

#
# Your code here
#

correct = 0
for person in party:
    if person.gear.owner == person.name:
        correct += 1
    else:
        print(person.name + " has " + person.gear.owner + "'s gear!")
assert correct == len(party)
print("Ok!")
```
