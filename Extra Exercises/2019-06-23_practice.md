Create a Dragon class.

A dragon can use legendary actions to completely avoid an attack. Lets limit this to 3 "saves" and model this in the class with 3 boolean members
```
save1 = True
save2 = True
save3 = True
```
Once a save is used, set it to False to mark that it can no longer be used.

Add a method to the class called ```take_damage```, where if the damage it is going to take is greater than 10 it uses a save (if available). Otherwise decrease its health.

Add a constructor for the dragon to set it's name and health.

Use this code test out your solution:

```
from random import randint

# Define Dragon

# Create a Dragon instance

while(dragon.health > 0):
    dmg = randint(1,20)
    dragon.take_damage(dmg)
```
