# 2019-07-10 Practice

There are 2 separate problems for this weeks practice exercises, you can do them in any order.

## Problem 1: Lists
Use the given Person class below.

Write a method called ```mass_healing``` that loops through a given list of People objects. For everyone who is *not* an enemy, increase their health by 7.

Set up your own test after writing the method (or write the test first, then the method) to check that your method works.

```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, health, is_enemy):
        self.name = name
        self.health = health
        self.is_enemy = is_enemy
```

## Problem 2: Debugging
The following program is likely the most complicated you've seen so far and uses some code that you haven't seen before. 

There are some bugs in the code that you have to find and fix. Anything "new" is correct, the bugs are only in parts of code that we have covered in previous lessons.

The program simulates a wizard doing damage to everyone within a certain range. There is a test at the bottom to check if the results match the expected behavior.

With the expected behavior in mind, read through the code step-by-step to see how it's being implemented - you might find the bugs before even running it.
```
import math

# 2D coordinates of Person
# (think of game board with tiles)
class Position2D:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, health):
        self.name = name
        self._health = health
        self.pos = Position2D(0, 0)

    def damage(self, amount):
        print(self.name + ": Ouch!")
        self._health -= amount

    def get_health(self):
        return self._health

    def set_pos(self, x, y):
        self.pos.x = x
        self.pos.y = y

class Wizard(Person):
    def cast_thunder_wave(self, targets):
        print("Thunder Wave! BBBZZZAPPP!!!")
        index = 0
        while index < len(targets):
            target = targets[index]
            if target != self or self.is_in_range(target, 3.5):
                target.damage(10)
            index += 1

    def is_in_range(self, target, spell_range):
        # distance formula
        x1 = self.pos.x
        y1 = self.pos.x
        x2 = target.pos.x
        y2 = target.pos.x
        dist = math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2)
        return dist <= spell_range

def set_up_combatants():
    combatants = []
    wizard = Wizard("Mageman Magicbeard", 60)
    wizard.set_pos(1, 1)
    combatants.append(wizard)

    guard = Person("Loyalist Guard 1", 60)
    guard.set_pos(2, 1.5)
    combatants.append(guard)

    guard = Person("Loyalist Guard 2", 60)
    guard.set_pos(-1, 0)
    combatants.append(guard)

    guard = Person("Loyalist Guard 3", 60)
    guard.set_pos(1.1, 2.7)
    combatants.append(guard)

    bystander = Person("Sally McInnocentGirl", 60)
    bystander.set_pos(10, 10)
    combatants.append(bystander)

    return combatants

# Set up everything and have wizard use thunder wave
combatants = set_up_combatants()
wizard = combatants[0]
wizard.cast_thunder_wave(combatants)

# check that cast_thunder_wave() behaves as expected:
# - guards are close so they should take 10 damage
# - girl is farther away so should not take damage
# - wizard should not take damage as the caster
index = 0
while index < len(combatants):
    person = combatants[index]
    if "Guard" in person.name:
        assert person.get_health == 50
    if "Innocent" in person.name:
        assert person.get_health == 60
    if "Mageman" in person.name:
        assert person.get_health == 60
    index += 1

print("All tests pass!")
