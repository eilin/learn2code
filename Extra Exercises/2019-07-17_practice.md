# Extra Practice 2019-07-17
Do these throughout the week.

## 1) The Growing Slime
There's a slime monster! Every time you slice it in half, one half melts away and the surviving half grows a cubic inch in volume. The slime dies when its volume is less than 5 cubic inches.

Example:

1. The slime starts at 12 cubic inches.
2. After the 1st slice, it is 6 cubic inches.
3. It then grows to 7 cubic inches.
4. After the 2nd slice, it is 3.5 cubic inches.
5. Since it is smaller than 5 cubic inches, it dies.

**Write a function that calculates the number of slices it takes to kill a slime of a given starting size.**

Example code:

```
slices = kill_slime(12.0)
print(slices) # should print 2

slices = kill_slime(14.1)
print(slices) # should print 3
```

## 2) Check Your Gear
You've arrived in a town and want to take the opportunity to fix your broken gear at the local smithy. Before you go, you need to look through your stuff and choose what to bring.

**Write a function that, given a list of your gear, returns a list of damaged items.**

Use the given class:
```
class Gear:
    def __init__(self, label, is_damaged):
        self.label = label
        self.is_damaged = is_damaged

    # this defines how print() will show this object
    def __repr__(self): 
        return self.label
```
Example code:
```
my_gear = [Gear('Boots', True), Gear('Flask', False), Gear('Compass', True)]
broken_gear = select_damaged(my_gear)

print(broken_gear) # should print [Boots, Compass]
```

## 3) Grog is Odd
Grog ain't good at math and wants to learn the difference between "even" and "odd" numbers. He asks lots of questions, like "Is 1 odd? Is 2 odd? Is 3 odd? ...What comes after 3?".

**Write a method that prints "Yes" if a given number is odd** 

> HINT: 'Even' numbers have no remainder when you divide by 2, 'Odd' numbers have a remainder of 1 when you divide by 2. 

> Google search "python remainder of division".

```
is_odd(1) # "Yes"
is_odd(2) # "No"
is_odd(3) # "Yes"
is_odd(4) # "No"
```

## 4) Weigh Too Much Stuff
Your party needs to ford a deep and wide river, but only a shoddy raft is available. Eyeing the loosely tied jumble of logs, your party decides to weigh everything the group is carrying to see if they might be too heavy to safely cross.

**Write a function that returns the total weight of everyones inventory.**

Use the given classes:
```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, inv):
        self.name = name
        self.inventory = inv

class Item:
    def __init__(self, label, weight):
        self.label = label
        self.weight = weight
```
Example code:
```
party = [
    Person("Atticus", [
        Item("Luggage", 11.0),
        Item("Book", 1.2)
    ]),
    Person("Chirrut", [
        Item("Pots", 13.5),
        Item("Foodstuff", 20.3)
    ])
]

weight = total_weight(party)
# 11 + 1.2 + 13.5 + 20.3 = 46.0
print(weight)  
```
