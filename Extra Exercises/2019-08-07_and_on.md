Alright, time to spread your wings and fly.

You should have a basic enough understanding of Python to go and learn/build on your own.

Here are your options from here on:

1) Create an account on HackerRank and practice solving coding problems.
    - Set your default language to Python 2 or 3.
    - I recommend starting with the domain "Algorithms" and subdomain "Warmup".
    - The questions are sometimes confusing, but the automated solution checker is very useful.

2) Go to the Udemy course I set up in your browser and learn more about Python.

3) Start your own small project.

As always, I am there to answer any questions and look forward to doing a project with you sometime.

Love,
Your Eddy
