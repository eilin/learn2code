# Exercise 0.1: Follow the Lecture
Run the "Hello World" program shown in the lesson from both a script and from interactive mode.

> Don't worry about what <code>print()</code> even _is_ at this point. We'll cover that later. Just know it 'prints' things to the terminal.

"Hello World!" is the traditional first program anyone writes when first learning a new language. Congrats!
