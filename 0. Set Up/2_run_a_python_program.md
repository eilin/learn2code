# Run Python Code
There are 2 ways to run python code:

1. From a script file.
2. In the interpreter's interactive mode.

## From a script (file)
You can write your code in a file (which is sometimes called a script), then tell the interpreter to use that file.

- Create a file called hello.py
- In the file, write: <br><code>print('hello world!')</code>
- In your terminal, run: <br><code>python hello.py</code>

You should see "hello world!" displayed on the next line in your terminal.

## Interactive Mode
Instead of giving the python interpreter a script to run, you can start it in _interactive_ mode where it waits for you to type in code for it to run.

- In your terminal, run: <br><code>python</code>
- write:<br><code>print('hello world!')</code>
<br>and then press [Enter]

Again, you should see "hello world!" displayed on the next line in your terminal.

You will stay in interactive mode until you exit.
> run <code>exit()</code> or press [Control D] to exit

## Pros and Cons
Interactive mode is usually used to quickly test out small pieces of code.

Any code that's more complicated, or intended to be used later/re-used, should be written in a script.
