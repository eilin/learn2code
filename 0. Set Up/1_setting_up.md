# Setting Up
Make sure your computer has a **python interpreter** installed.

>The **interpreter** is just a special program that turns the python code you write into instructions that the computer can understand and execute.

Most computers running macOS or linux already have python installed. Try opening a terminal and running:

<code>python --version</code>

It is recommended to have an IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) set up as well. IDEs are text editors for writing code and offer helpful features such as code auto-complete, debugging, refactoring, and much more.

I recommend Visual Studio Code as a good general use IDE.
