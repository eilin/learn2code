# Learn to Code

This lesson plan is intended for an experienced programmer to act as instructor for the beginner.

## Shallow but Wide
The goal of this lesson plan is to introduce a total beginner to concepts of programming, opting to first cover as many basic topics as possible instead of going in-depth with every topic. The hope is to show the "big picture" of what is possible, and to provide a wide foundation to build future knowledge.

## Learn by Doing
Short exercises follow each newly introduced topic. These are for the student to complete and implement what they just learned.

Exercises are written to be vaguely DnD themed to stay interesting (I hope).
